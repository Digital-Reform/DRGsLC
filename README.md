# Digital//Reform's Golang slog Configuration (DRGsLC)
This provides an easy way to override the default behaviors to be more readable in development environments and how it should output to files in deployment environments.  
> [!NOTE]
> This is intended for projects within Digital//Reform and it's needs, but is available to the public for the sake of openness and refrence for other developers

## Should you use this?
Probably not, slog itself is pleanty powerful and our implementation is yet to be fully optimized (if ever), so consider using the default or other implementations

## Installation
Follow the standard for any Golang Module posted on github, and it should work out of the box.

> This was designed and tested on Linux (WSL), so Windows interoperability is not guaranteed
